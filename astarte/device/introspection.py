    Class that represent the introspection of a device.

    The introspection is the list od interfaces that the device declares to the server it is
    compatible with.

    In any given time a device can have a single interface with a given name, multiple interfaces
    with the same name but different major/minor are not supported.

        This will add an Interface definition to the Device. It has to be called before

        Parameters
        ----------
        interface_definition : dict
            An Astarte Interface definition in the form of a Python dictionary. Usually obtained
