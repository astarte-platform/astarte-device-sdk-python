class Interface:
    """
    Class that represent an Interface definition

    Interfaces are a core concept of Astarte which defines how data is exchanged between Astarte
    and its peers. They are not to be intended as OOP interfaces, but rather as the following
    definition:

    In Astarte each interface has an owner, can represent either a continuous data stream or a
    snapshot of a set of properties, and can be either aggregated into an object or be an
    independent set of individual members.

    Attributes
    ----------
        name: str
            Interface name
        version_major: int
            Interface version major number
        version_minor: int
            Interface version minor number
        type: str
            Interface type
        ownership: str
            Interface ownership
        aggregation: str
            Interface aggregation policy
